# media-server
Low memory media storage and metadata tracker.
With "virtual objects", can select from multiple objects depending on requested content type, width, and height.
While primarily for images it can store other common file types too.

## Things done

1. Uploading Objects
2. Creating Virtual Objects
3. Asserting Virtual Object relationships
4. File lookup by object path
5. Virtual object path lookup
6. Refactor and improve content type to extension mapping
7. Extension to content type mapping
8. Refactor lookup handler code
9. Support multiple path lookup for virtual object
10. Parse content extension and encoding extension
11. Refactored content type and extension code
12. Refactored object, virtual object, find, and hash code
13. Redo file extension as content type parameter
14. Store content encoding (as input) onto record
15. Override extension to content type
16. Override encoding to content encoding
17. Handler path supports `r<w>x<h>/` prefixing instead of query params
18. Parse form file name into content encoding and content type
19. Add support for responding with content encoding depending on extension
20. Custom file copy method, Rocket's persist method does not work across devices
21. Custom NamedFile response (FileContent)
22. Refactor to use a route handler instead of a guard and handler
23. Virtual Object info endpoint
24. No longer rely upon public path on object
24. Create virtual object for content hash
25. Create virtual object for object if path is set
26. Upsert should update content encoding
27. Upsert should update content type

## Next things to do

### Error Response
* Custom error type and error response

## Other
* Use tokio async file for writing data and hashing files

### Meta Data
* Virtual Object tags
* Virtual Object path prefixes

### Content Types and Encoding
* Filter content type in database query
* Determine content type and encoding by extension during upload (e.g. `.js.gz => text/javascript gzip`)

### Virtual Object Enhancements
* Virtual Object can list prioritized content type in case user content type is not specified
* Better virtual object choice by resolution
* Use transaction around inserts with last insert id

### Object enhancements
* Use transaction around persisting file
* Insert / Update custom headers

### Content Response
* Send headers on objects with custom named file response
* Store headers on objects
* Send custom headers on objects
* Last Modified
* Vary?
* CORS
* Content type no sniff
* age
* If Modified Since
* If None Match
* Support content range requests
